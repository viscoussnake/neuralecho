# Neural Echo: Parallel Minds

An interactive narrative experience exploring the boundaries between neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and human consciousness.

## About

Neural Echo: Parallel Minds is a text-based narrative game where you play as Dr. Elias Reeves, a neurosurgeon who finds himself at the intersection of emerging AI technologies and unusual neurological cases. As you navigate these complex domains while raising a daughter who seems to have mysterious connections to your patients, reality itself begins to fragment.

The game features:

- **Interweaving storylines** across clinical, AI, and family narratives
- **Branching timelines** that visualize your key decisions
- **Relationship graph** showing connections between characters
- **Philosophical exploration** of consciousness, identity, and reality

## Running the Game

To run Neural Echo, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed
2. Clone this repository
3. Navigate to the project directory
4. Run the development server:

```bash
node server.js
```

5. Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000

## Gameplay

The game presents narrative text and offers choices that affect the story. Your decisions may lead to new timeline branches, representing parallel realities. The relationship panel shows connections between characters, while the timeline visualization helps you track different reality branches.

## Technical Overview

Neural Echo is built using:

- HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript
- SVG for visualizations
- In-memory simulation of a SQLite database
- Knowledge graph for tracking relationships
- Timeline management for parallel narratives

## Development

This game was developed as an exploration of the themes at the intersection of neuroscience and artificial intelligence, with particular focus on the philosophical questions raised by advances in both fields.
